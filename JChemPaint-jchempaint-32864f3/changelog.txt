3.1.3
----

New features:
* R-groups
* Reaction arrow tool for comfortable drawing of reactions
* New applet parameter "mol" accepting string with MOL file
* Features (=groups of ui elements) can be switched on and off in the applet params (trac #83)
* A chain drawing tool has been added

Fixes:
* The molecule title was not written to MDL files (but read from), now both ways work (trac #70)
* In certain situations open/save as/save confused file names (trac #77)
* Touching the isotopes menu gave exceptions if empty model or no selectio (trac #64)
* c1ccccc1 is no pasted correctly (#84/109)

New features:
* Quasi-3D rotation tool
* The javadoc for JChemPaintAbstractApplet contains applet parameter documentation
* Enhanced template list
* More public applet methods (see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/steinbeck-srv/jchempaint-nightly/javadoc/org/openscience/jchempaint/applet/JChemPaintAbstractApplet.html)
* Cross platform drag&drop support for molecule files

3.0.1
-----
New features:
* Interaction with tables and spectrum applet (see hightlightTable and spectrumRenderer applet parameters)

Fixes:
* Tooltips parameter in applet works
* (Virtually) Complete tranlations for Polish, Hungarian, Spanish, Czech
* Cancel in Enter Element dialog created empty elements
* All properties in the preferences dialog are stored in file system
* Undo/Redo buttons active after drawing a ring (trac #58)
* Phenyl rings no longer aromatic. Since aromaticity was not considered anywhere else, this lead to wrong H counts (trac #60)
* Large menus (transition metals only right now) are now two columns to fit on screen (trac #47)
* Certain functions (cleanup, open/save cml) failed in the applet due to problems with shrinking
