# ChemisFree
A desktop application suit for chemists, providing utilities for molecule editing/recognition and article management.
# Features
(In order of appearance in the Application Bar).

## Application Bar
This is the first thing you see when the application launches. A portal if you will, to the various features available.

## Molecule Image Recognition
Take a screenshot of a molecule you wish to edit/view, utilizing 2 separate engines, Imago and Molvec.

## Molecule Editor/Viewer
Utilizing JChemPaint (as seen above), which can be opened either by clicking on a Molecule from the Text Editor, Molecule Image Recognition, Search or as standalone.

## Text Editor
Utilizing text image recognition and manual entry for recipes and articles, providing molecule information with save/load capabilities.

## Search
A simple yet powerful molecule search tool, allowing for both SMILES and plain name inputs.

## Mobile Actions (implementation pending)
Mobile intercommunication with the desktop application, with the ability to use your phone's camera as a means for Molecule/Text Recognition, and articles exchange.

## Molecule Details
There is another feature in the application, providing the user with details such as smiles, weight, xlogP, logP, tpsa etc, by clicking on a Molecule in Text Editor or Search. However this is still in very early development (as is this whole application in general), as such no image is provided.

## Misc tools
Such as a timer and calculator.
